# .dotfiles

starting out on my dotfiles journey. 'it's dangerous to go alone! take this.'

in case of emergency
install apple command line dev tools ```xcode-select --install```
install home-brew

how to use this:
clone https://github.com/kiddspazz/dotfiles into $HOME
run setup.sh

right now this only works for macOS terminal configs -- need to update for linux distros as well
